## Guide

### Prerequisites

* **Software**: [Git][git-install], and [Hugo][hugo-install]. As an example of working configuration:
```bash
git --version
hugo version
```

* **Hardware**: 2 CPUs, 8GB memory RAM.

### Getting started

Make sure that you have installed `Git` and `Hugo`, **in particular**, you must install Hugo with its [extended_0.65+ version][hugo-version]. And then set

Steps:

1. Clone this project & get into it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cross-species/pj2.git
cd pj2
```
*Note:*
We assume you are looking for the master module so you can make your own submodule.
If not, update all the submodules:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Run the following command:
```bash
# Since we have removed the academic theme for `git commit` but hugo needs theme, we need to reinstall it.
git clone https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic.git themes/academic
hugo server
```

3. Git commit: 
Since the **Git cache of theme `academic`** comflict with the **Git of our main part**, we need to remove it for `git commit`.
```bash
rm -rf ./themes/academic
git add .
git commit -m "<your commit name>"
git push
```

The site will be ready after a while in `http://localhost:1313`.
